### 🌱 In love with flutter & dart, build mobile apps and PWA, curious to collaborate on open-source project.
#### 🔭 I’m currently working on goGreen a flutter mobile app that help users find local services providers around you using google cloud firebase,google maps and gps.
- 💬 Ask me about flutter, firebase or dart.
- ⚡ Fun fact: started programming because of the movie iron man & tony stark, but in reality tony stark is not tech inclinde. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source community in my locality relating to web and flutter.
- The last thing i worked on is scoreline; an app that works on web(pwa) and mobile. All it does is show football highlights
